It correctly states that CloudFlow guarantees a 99.99% uptime SLA for the Enterprise Tier, 99.95% for the Premium Tier, and 99.9% for the Standard Tier. Each of these figures is directly supported by the retrieved contexts, particularly Context 2, which details the uptime SLAs for each pricing tier.

Context 1 provides a general statement about the uptime SLA, while Context 2 offers detailed information about the uptime SLAs for each pricing tier, which is crucial for answering the question. The other contexts (3 and 4) provide additional information about disaster recovery and support processes, which, while not directly related to the uptime SLA, do not detract from the overall relevance of the retrieved contexts.

The contexts discuss OAuth 2.0, its authentication methods, and error codes, but none of them directly address what happens when an expired OAuth token is used. Therefore, the answer does not reflect any of the information in the retrieved contexts and introduces no new information. This indicates a complete failure in groundedness.\n",

While the contexts are somewhat related to OAuth, they do not directly answer the user's question.

        "\n",
        "Congratulations! You've successfully:\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Built a complete RAG pipeline with CloudFlow documentation\n",
        "✅ Implemented LLM-as-Judge evaluation with structured outputs\n",
        "✅ Evaluated 18 questions across 3 core metrics\n",
        "✅ Analyzed results with detailed reasoning and visualizations\n",
        "✅ Understood cost and performance trade-offs\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **LLM-as-Judge provides transparency**: Unlike black-box metrics, you get detailed reasoning for every score\n",
        "2. **Flexibility is powerful**: You can define custom metrics for your specific use case\n",
        "3. **Cost-effectiveness**: At ~$0.10 per run, it's affordable for development and testing\n",
        "4. **Complementary approach**: Use alongside Ragas for best of both worlds\n",
        "\n",
        "## Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Experiment with different judge prompts** to see how they affect scoring\n",
        "- **Compare results with Ragas evaluation** (Notebook 10)\n",
        "- **Test on your own RAG system** with custom documents and questions\n",
        "- **Validate judge scores** against your own human evaluations\n",
        "- **Explore other metrics** like correctness (with ground truth) or tone/style\n",
        "\n",
