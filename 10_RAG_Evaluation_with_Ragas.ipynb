    "\n",
    "Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) adjusts the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization (target: 70%) and memory usage (target: 80%). When these thresholds are exceeded for more than 3 consecutive minutes, the system automatically provisions additional pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vertical scaling adjusts resource allocation for individual services. CloudFlow can increase or decrease CPU and memory limits without downtime, using Kubernetes resource management capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform supports bursting to handle sudden traffic spikes. During burst periods, CloudFlow can temporarily scale up to 500% of baseline capacity for up to 15 minutes before triggering permanent scaling.\n",

    "Connection Management: Reuse HTTP connections with keep-alive headers. Maintain a connection pool with 5-10 concurrent connections per API key. Set appropriate timeouts: connection timeout 10s, read timeout 30s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Efficiency: Use field filtering to request only required data: /resources?fields=id,name,status. Leverage server-side filtering instead of retrieving all data and filtering locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous Processing: For long-running operations, use CloudFlow's async API endpoints. Poll for results using the returned job_id rather than blocking on the initial request.\n",

To implement it, direct users to the authorization endpoint at `https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize` with your `client_id` and `redirect_uri` parameters. Access tokens are valid for 1 hour, and refresh tokens are valid for 30 days.\n",

    "**Difficulty:** 🔰 BEGINNER\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Ragas?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ragas** (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment) is the industry-standard framework for evaluating RAG systems. It provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automated evaluation metrics for RAG quality\n",
    "- LLM-based and traditional metrics\n",
    "- Integration with popular frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex)\n",
    "- Comprehensive evaluation across retrieval and generation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Evaluate RAG Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without evaluation, you can't:\n",
    "- ❌ Know if answers are accurate and grounded\n",
    "- ❌ Compare different configurations (chunk size, k value, etc.)\n",
    "- ❌ Identify failure patterns\n",
    "- ❌ Optimize for production deployment\n",
    "- ❌ Track quality over time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Ragas Metrics (6 Non-Multimodal Metrics)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement all 6 core non-multimodal metrics in this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Faithfulness** 🔍\n",
    "- **What it measures**: Are the answers grounded in the retrieved context?\n",
    "- **How it works**: Uses LLM to verify if answer statements can be inferred from context\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Prevents hallucinations\n",
    "- **Target score**: >0.7\n",
    "- **Speed**: Slow (~2-3s per question, requires LLM calls)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Answer Relevancy (Response Relevancy)** 📊\n",
    "- **What it measures**: Is the answer relevant to the question?\n",
    "- **How it works**: Uses embeddings to measure semantic relevance\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Ensures on-topic responses\n",
    "- **Target score**: >0.7\n",
    "- **Speed**: Fast (~0.5s per question)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Context Precision** 🎯\n",
    "- **What it measures**: Are the most relevant chunks ranked highest?\n",
    "- **How it works**: Checks if relevant chunks appear early in retrieval results\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Evaluates retrieval algorithm quality\n",
    "- **Target score**: >0.6\n",
    "- **Speed**: Medium (~1s per question)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Context Recall** ✅\n",
    "- **What it measures**: Was all necessary information retrieved?\n",
    "- **How it works**: Compares retrieved contexts against ground truth\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Ensures complete information coverage\n",
    "- **Target score**: >0.6\n",
    "- **Speed**: Medium (~1s per question)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Context Entity Recall** 🏷️\n",
    "- **What it measures**: Are key entities from ground truth present in retrieved contexts?\n",
    "- **How it works**: Extracts entities from ground truth and checks presence in contexts\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Ensures important named entities are retrieved\n",
    "- **Target score**: >0.6\n",
    "- **Speed**: Medium (~1-2s per question)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Noise Sensitivity** 🎚️\n",
    "- **What it measures**: Is the system robust to irrelevant/noisy context?\n",
    "- **How it works**: Tests if system can ignore distractors in retrieved contexts\n",
    "- **Why it matters**: Evaluates robustness in real-world scenarios with imperfect retrieval\n",
    "- **Target score**: >0.7\n",
    "- **Speed**: Slow (~2-3s per question)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metric Types\n",
    "\n",
    "**LLM-Based Metrics** (faithfulness, context_precision, context_recall, context_entity_recall, noise_sensitivity):\n",
    "- More accurate, closer to human evaluation\n",
    "- Slower and more expensive (requires LLM calls)\n",
    "- Slightly non-deterministic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embedding-Based Metrics** (answer_relevancy):\n",
    "- Faster and cheaper\n",
    "- Deterministic\n",
    "- Good for rapid iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We're excluding multimodal metrics (Multimodal Faithfulness, Multimodal Relevance) as they're for image/video content evaluation."

[CloudFlow API Authentication\\n\\nCloudFlow APIs support two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 and API Keys. Both methods provide secure access to platform resources.\\n\\nOAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications. It supports the Authorization Code flow and provides access tokens valid for 1 hour and refresh tokens valid for 30 days. To implement OAuth 2.0, direct users to the authorization endpoint at https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize with your client_id and redirect_uri parameters.\\n\\nAPI Keys are ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs.

[CloudFlow Architecture Overview\\n\\nCloudFlow is a distributed cloud platform built on microservices architecture. The platform consists of three main layers that work together to provide a robust, scalable infrastructure.\\n\\nThe API Gateway layer handles all incoming requests using OAuth 2.0 authentication and routes them through our service mesh powered by Istio. This layer provides load balancing, SSL termination, and request routing capabilities.\\n\\nThe Service Mesh layer orchestrates communication between microservices, providing service discovery, health checking, and automatic failover. It uses Kubernetes for container orchestration across multiple availability zones.\\n\\nThe Data Storage layer implements a distributed database system with automatic replication across three availability zones. This ensures data durability and supports horizontal scaling based on demand., CloudFlow System Components\\n\\nCloudFlow's architecture comprises several key components that work in harmony to deliver reliable cloud services.\\n\\nThe Control Plane manages the overall system state, including service registration, configuration management, and orchestration. It runs on a dedicated cluster with five replicas for high availability.\\n\\nThe Data Plane handles actual request processing and data flow. It consists of worker nodes that execute application workloads and process user requests. Each data plane node has 16 CPU cores and 64GB RAM.\\n\\nThe Observability Stack includes Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation. Metrics are collected every 15 seconds and retained for 90 days.\\n\\nThe Service Registry maintains a real-time directory of all available services and their endpoints. It uses etcd for distributed consensus and supports automatic service discovery with DNS-based lookups., CloudFlow Security Features\\n\\nSecurity is a top priority at CloudFlow. We implement industry-leading security practices to protect your data and applications.\\n\\nEncryption: All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit uses TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy. Encryption keys are rotated every 90 days using AWS KMS.\\n\\nNetwork Security: CloudFlow runs in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with strict network segmentation. Public endpoints are protected by Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules that block common attack patterns. DDoS protection is provided by Cloudflare with mitigation capacity up to 50 Gbps.\\n\\nAccess Control: All resources support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with customizable roles and permissions. We support integration with external identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect., CloudFlow Pricing Tiers\\n\\nCloudFlow offers three pricing tiers designed to meet the needs of individuals, teams, and enterprises.\\n\\nStandard Tier ($99/month):\\n- 1,000 API requests per hour\\n- 100 GB storage included\\n- 10 GB bandwidth per month\\n- Community support via forums\\n- 99.9% uptime SLA\\n- Up to 5 team members\\n\\nPremium Tier ($499/month):\\n- 10,000 API requests per hour\\n- 1 TB storage included\\n- 100 GB bandwidth per month\\n- Email support with 24-hour response time\\n- 99.95% uptime SLA\\n- Up to 25 team members\\n- Advanced monitoring and alerting\\n- Custom domain support\\n\\nEnterprise Tier (Custom pricing):\\n- Custom API rate limits (100,000+ requests/hour)\\n- Unlimited storage and bandwidth\\n- 24/7 phone and email support with 1-hour response time\\n- 99.99% uptime SLA with service credits\\n- Unlimited team members\\n- Dedicated account manager\\n- Custom integrations and professional services\\n- Private cloud deployment options]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The three main layers of CloudFlow architecture are:\\n\\n1. **API Gateway Layer**: Handles all incoming requests, provides OAuth 2.0 authentication, load balancing, SSL termination, and request routing.\\n\\n2. **Service Mesh Layer**: Orchestrates communication between microservices, offering service discovery, health checking, and automatic failover, utilizing Kubernetes for container orchestration.\\n\\n3. **Data Storage Layer**: Implements a distributed database system with automatic replication across three availability zones for data durability and horizontal scaling.

[CloudFlow API Error Codes\\n\\nCloudFlow APIs use standard HTTP status codes and provide detailed error messages in JSON format to help diagnose issues.\\n\\nAuthentication Errors:\\n- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid API key. Check the Authorization header.\\n- 403 Forbidden: Valid API key but insufficient permissions for the requested operation.\\n\\nClient Errors:\\n- 400 Bad Request: Invalid request format or missing required fields. The response includes a \"details\" field explaining what's wrong.\\n- 404 Not Found: Requested resource doesn't exist. Verify the resource ID.\\n- 409 Conflict: Request conflicts with current resource state (e.g., duplicate name).\\n- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Request format is valid but contains semantic errors.\\n- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded. Check X-RateLimit-Reset header., Error: \"Timeout\" (504)\\nSolution: Increase client timeout to at least 30 seconds. For long-running operations, use async endpoints and poll for results. Check CloudFlow status page for any service degradation.\\n\\nError: \"Validation Error\" (422)\\nSolution: Review the error details field for specific validation failures. Common issues: missing required fields, invalid data types, values outside allowed ranges. Consult API documentation for correct request format., CloudFlow API Authentication\\n\\nCloudFlow APIs support two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 and API Keys. Both methods provide secure access to platform resources.\\n\\nOAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications. It supports the Authorization Code flow and provides access tokens valid for 1 hour and refresh tokens valid for 30 days. To implement OAuth 2.0, direct users to the authorization endpoint at https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize with your client_id and redirect_uri parameters.\\n\\nAPI Keys are ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs. Each API key has the format \"cf_live_\" followed by 32 alphanumeric characters. API keys never expire unless explicitly revoked.\\n\\nTo authenticate requests, include your API key in the Authorization header: \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\". All API requests must be made over HTTPS; HTTP requests will be rejected with a 403 error., Step 5 - Check Network Connectivity: Ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS traffic to *.cloudflow.io on port 443. Verify DNS resolution is working correctly.\\n\\nStep 6 - Verify SDK Version: If using CloudFlow SDK, ensure you're running the latest version. Outdated SDKs may not support new API features or may have known bugs.\\n\\nStep 7 - Contact Support: If issues persist, contact CloudFlow support with the request ID from failed requests. Support responds within 24 hours for Standard tier, 4 hours for Premium, 1 hour for Enterprise.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The HTTP status codes that indicate authentication failures in CloudFlow API are:\\n\\n- **401 Unauthorized**: This indicates a missing or invalid API key.

[CloudFlow Scaling Mechanisms\\n\\nCloudFlow implements sophisticated auto-scaling mechanisms to handle varying workloads efficiently. The platform monitors real-time metrics to make intelligent scaling decisions.\\n\\nHorizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) adjusts the number of pod replicas based on CPU utilization (target: 70%) and memory usage (target: 80%). When these thresholds are exceeded for more than 3 consecutive minutes, the system automatically provisions additional pods.\\n\\nVertical scaling adjusts resource allocation for individual services. CloudFlow can increase or decrease CPU and memory limits without downtime, using Kubernetes resource management capabilities.\\n\\nThe platform supports bursting to handle sudden traffic spikes. During burst periods, CloudFlow can temporarily scale up to 500% of baseline capacity for up to 15 minutes before triggering permanent scaling., CloudFlow Monitoring and Observability\\n\\nEffective monitoring ensures your CloudFlow applications remain healthy and performant.\\n\\nMetrics Collection: CloudFlow automatically collects key metrics including request rate, error rate, latency (p50, p95, p99), and resource utilization. Access metrics via the dashboard or Metrics API at /api/v1/metrics.\\n\\nCustom Metrics: Send custom application metrics using the StatsD protocol. CloudFlow aggregates custom metrics every 60 seconds and retains them for 90 days.\\n\\nAlerting: Configure alerts for critical conditions like error rate >5%, latency >500ms, or approaching rate limits. CloudFlow supports alerting via email, SMS, Slack, PagerDuty, and webhooks.\\n\\nDistributed Tracing: Enable distributed tracing to track requests across services. CloudFlow supports OpenTelemetry and provides trace visualization in the dashboard. Sample rate: 10% of requests (configurable up to 100%)., CloudFlow guarantees 99.99% uptime SLA with triple redundancy across availability zones. The platform supports horizontal scaling with automatic load balancing, allowing each service to scale independently based on CPU and memory metrics., CloudFlow System Components\\n\\nCloudFlow's architecture comprises several key components that work in harmony to deliver reliable cloud services.\\n\\nThe Control Plane manages the overall system state, including service registration, configuration management, and orchestration. It runs on a dedicated cluster with five replicas for high availability.\\n\\nThe Data Plane handles actual request processing and data flow. It consists of worker nodes that execute application workloads and process user requests. Each data plane node has 16 CPU cores and 64GB RAM.\\n\\nThe Observability Stack includes Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation. Metrics are collected every 15 seconds and retained for 90 days.\\n\\nThe Service Registry maintains a real-time directory of all available services and their endpoints. It uses etcd for distributed consensus and supports automatic service discovery with DNS-based lookups.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    CloudFlow monitors CPU utilization (target: 70%) and memory usage (target: 80%) for its Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA).

[CloudFlow API Authentication\\n\\nCloudFlow APIs support two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 and API Keys. Both methods provide secure access to platform resources.\\n\\nOAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications. It supports the Authorization Code flow and provides access tokens valid for 1 hour and refresh tokens valid for 30 days. To implement OAuth 2.0, direct users to the authorization endpoint at https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize with your client_id and redirect_uri parameters.\\n\\nAPI Keys are ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs. Each API key has the format \"cf_live_\" followed by 32 alphanumeric characters. API keys never expire unless explicitly revoked.\\n\\nTo authenticate requests, include your API key in the Authorization header: \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\". All API requests must be made over HTTPS; HTTP requests will be rejected with a 403 error., API keys can be scoped to specific permissions (read, write, admin) and restricted to specific IP addresses for enhanced security. You can manage your API keys through the CloudFlow dashboard or the /api/v1/keys endpoint., CloudFlow API Error Codes\\n\\nCloudFlow APIs use standard HTTP status codes and provide detailed error messages in JSON format to help diagnose issues.\\n\\nAuthentication Errors:\\n- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid API key. Check the Authorization header.\\n- 403 Forbidden: Valid API key but insufficient permissions for the requested operation.\\n\\nClient Errors:\\n- 400 Bad Request: Invalid request format or missing required fields. The response includes a \"details\" field explaining what's wrong.\\n- 404 Not Found: Requested resource doesn't exist. Verify the resource ID.\\n- 409 Conflict: Request conflicts with current resource state (e.g., duplicate name).\\n- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Request format is valid but contains semantic errors.\\n- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded. Check X-RateLimit-Reset header., Common CloudFlow Errors and Solutions\\n\\nThis guide covers the most common errors encountered when using CloudFlow and their solutions.\\n\\nError: \"Invalid API Key\" (401)\\nSolution: Verify your API key format starts with \"cf_live_\" and is exactly 40 characters. Check for extra spaces or newlines. Generate a new API key if the issue persists. API keys are case-sensitive.\\n\\nError: \"Rate Limit Exceeded\" (429)\\nSolution: Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic. Check X-RateLimit-Reset header to know when limits reset. Consider upgrading to a higher tier if you consistently hit limits. Use batch endpoints to reduce request count.\\n\\nError: \"Resource Not Found\" (404)\\nSolution: Verify the resource ID is correct and the resource hasn't been deleted.

      "13  How does OAuth 2.0 authentication differ from API key authentication in CloudFlow?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [CloudFlow API Authentication\\n\\nCloudFlow APIs support two authentication methods: OAuth 2.0 and API Keys. Both methods provide secure access to platform resources.\\n\\nOAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications. It supports the Authorization Code flow and provides access tokens valid for 1 hour and refresh tokens valid for 30 days. To implement OAuth 2.0, direct users to the authorization endpoint at https://auth.cloudflow.io/oauth/authorize with your client_id and redirect_uri parameters.\\n\\nAPI Keys are ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs. Each API key has the format \"cf_live_\" followed by 32 alphanumeric characters. API keys never expire unless explicitly revoked.\\n\\nTo authenticate requests, include your API key in the Authorization header: \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\". All API requests must be made over HTTPS; HTTP requests will be rejected with a 403 error., CloudFlow Security Features\\n\\nSecurity is a top priority at CloudFlow. We implement industry-leading security practices to protect your data and applications.\\n\\nEncryption: All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit uses TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy. Encryption keys are rotated every 90 days using AWS KMS.\\n\\nNetwork Security: CloudFlow runs in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with strict network segmentation. Public endpoints are protected by Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules that block common attack patterns. DDoS protection is provided by Cloudflare with mitigation capacity up to 50 Gbps.\\n\\nAccess Control: All resources support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with customizable roles and permissions. We support integration with external identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect., CloudFlow API Error Codes\\n\\nCloudFlow APIs use standard HTTP status codes and provide detailed error messages in JSON format to help diagnose issues.\\n\\nAuthentication Errors:\\n- 401 Unauthorized: Missing or invalid API key. Check the Authorization header.\\n- 403 Forbidden: Valid API key but insufficient permissions for the requested operation.\\n\\nClient Errors:\\n- 400 Bad Request: Invalid request format or missing required fields. The response includes a \"details\" field explaining what's wrong.\\n- 404 Not Found: Requested resource doesn't exist. Verify the resource ID.\\n- 409 Conflict: Request conflicts with current resource state (e.g., duplicate name).\\n- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Request format is valid but contains semantic errors.\\n- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded. Check X-RateLimit-Reset header., CloudFlow Architecture Overview\\n\\nCloudFlow is a distributed cloud platform built on microservices architecture. The platform consists of three main layers that work together to provide a robust, scalable infrastructure.\\n\\nThe API Gateway layer handles all incoming requests using OAuth 2.0 authentication and routes them through our service mesh powered by Istio. This layer provides load balancing, SSL termination, and request routing capabilities.\\n\\nThe Service Mesh layer orchestrates communication between microservices, providing service discovery, health checking, and automatic failover. It uses Kubernetes for container orchestration across multiple availability zones.\\n\\nThe Data Storage layer implements a distributed database system with automatic replication across three availability zones. This ensures data durability and supports horizontal scaling based on demand.]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               OAuth 2.0 authentication is recommended for user-facing applications and supports the Authorization Code flow, providing access tokens valid for 1 hour and refresh tokens valid for 30 days. Users are directed to an authorization endpoint with parameters like client_id and redirect_uri.\\n\\nIn contrast, API key authentication is ideal for server-to-server communication and background jobs. Each API key has the format \"cf_live_\" followed by 32 alphanumeric characters and never expires unless revoked. API keys are included in the Authorization header as \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\".\\n\\nAdditionally, all API requests must be made over HTTPS, and while OAuth 2.0 is more suited for user interactions, API keys are simpler for automated processes.  OAuth 2.0 is recommended for user-facing applications with access tokens valid for 1 hour and provides the Authorization Code flow, while API keys are ideal for server-to-server communication, never expire unless revoked, and have a simpler implementation.

Check for extra spaces or newlines. Generate a new API key if the issue persists. API keys are case-sensitive.\\n\\nError: \"Rate Limit Exceeded\" (429)\\nSolution: Implement exponential backoff in your retry logic. Check X-RateLimit-Reset header to know when limits reset. Consider upgrading to a higher tier if you consistently hit limits. Use batch endpoints to reduce request count.\\n\\nError: \"Resource Not Found\" (404)\\nSolution: Verify the resource ID is correct and the resource hasn't been deleted. Use the /api/v1/resources endpoint to list available resources. Check if you're using the correct API version (/v1).]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          If you receive a 504 timeout error, increase the client timeout to at least 30 seconds.

[CloudFlow Debugging Guide\\n\\nWhen troubleshooting issues with CloudFlow, follow this systematic debugging approach.\\n\\nStep 1 - Check Service Status: Visit status.cloudflow.io to verify all systems are operational. Subscribe to status updates to receive notifications about incidents and maintenance.\\n\\nStep 2 - Review API Logs: Access detailed API logs in the CloudFlow dashboard under Analytics > API Logs. Filter by time range, status code, and endpoint. Look for patterns in failed requests.\\n\\nStep 3 - Enable Debug Mode: Add X-CloudFlow-Debug: true header to requests to receive detailed debug information in responses. Debug mode provides request ID, processing time breakdown, and backend service information.\\n\\nStep 4 - Test with curl: Isolate issues by testing with curl commands. Example: curl -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" -H \"X-CloudFlow-Debug: true\" https://api.cloudflow.io/v1/resources, Error: \"Timeout\" (504)\\nSolution: Increase client timeout to at least 30 seconds. For long-running operations, use async endpoints and poll for results. Check CloudFlow status page for any service degradation.\\n\\nError: \"Validation Error\" (422)\\nSolution: Review the error details field for specific validation failures. Common issues: missing required fields, invalid data types, values outside allowed ranges. Consult API documentation for correct request format., CloudFlow Performance Optimization\\n\\nFollowing these best practices will help you achieve optimal performance from your CloudFlow applications.\\n\\nCaching Strategy: Implement caching at multiple levels. Use CloudFlow's built-in Redis cache for frequently accessed data with TTL between 5-60 minutes. Cache API responses on the client side and respect Cache-Control headers.\\n\\nRequest Optimization: Batch multiple operations into single API calls when possible. Use pagination for large result sets (recommended page size: 50-100 items). Implement request compression using gzip to reduce bandwidth.\\n\\nConnection Management: Reuse HTTP connections with keep-alive headers. Maintain a connection pool with 5-10 concurrent connections per API key. Set appropriate timeouts: connection timeout 10s, read timeout 30s.\\n\\nQuery Efficiency: Use field filtering to request only required data: /resources?fields=id,name,status. Leverage server-side filtering instead of retrieving all data and filtering locally., Step 5 - Check Network Connectivity: Ensure your network allows outbound HTTPS traffic to *.cloudflow.io on port 443.

[CloudFlow Architecture Overview\\n\\nCloudFlow is a distributed cloud platform built on microservices architecture. The platform consists of three main layers that work together to provide a robust, scalable infrastructure.\\n\\nThe API Gateway layer handles all incoming requests using OAuth 2.0 authentication and routes them through our service mesh powered by Istio. This layer provides load balancing, SSL termination, and request routing capabilities.\\n\\nThe Service Mesh layer orchestrates communication between microservices, providing service discovery, health checking, and automatic failover. It uses Kubernetes for container orchestration across multiple availability zones.\\n\\nThe Data Storage layer implements a distributed database system with automatic replication across three availability zones. This ensures data durability and supports horizontal scaling based on demand., CloudFlow Security Features\\n\\nSecurity is a top priority at CloudFlow. We implement industry-leading security practices to protect your data and applications.\\n\\nEncryption: All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Data in transit uses TLS 1.3 with perfect forward secrecy. Encryption keys are rotated every 90 days using AWS KMS.\\n\\nNetwork Security: CloudFlow runs in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with strict network segmentation. Public endpoints are protected by Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules that block common attack patterns. DDoS protection is provided by Cloudflare with mitigation capacity up to 50 Gbps.\\n\\nAccess Control: All resources support Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with customizable roles and permissions. We support integration with external identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect., CloudFlow System Components\\n\\nCloudFlow's architecture comprises several key components that work in harmony to deliver reliable cloud services.\\n\\nThe Control Plane manages the overall system state, including service registration, configuration management, and orchestration. It runs on a dedicated cluster with five replicas for high availability.\\n\\nThe Data Plane handles actual request processing and data flow. It consists of worker nodes that execute application workloads and process user requests. Each data plane node has 16 CPU cores and 64GB RAM.\\n\\nThe Observability Stack includes Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation. Metrics are collected every 15 seconds and retained for 90 days.\\n\\nThe Service Registry maintains a real-time directory of all available services and their endpoints. It uses etcd for distributed consensus and supports automatic service discovery with DNS-based lookups., CloudFlow Pricing Tiers\\n\\nCloudFlow offers three pricing tiers designed to meet the needs of individuals, teams, and enterprises.\\n\\nStandard Tier ($99/month):\\n- 1,000 API requests per hour\\n- 100 GB storage included\\n- 10 GB bandwidth per month\\n- Community support via forums\\n- 99.9% uptime SLA\\n- Up to 5 team members\\n\\nPremium Tier ($499/month):\\n- 10,000 API requests per hour\\n- 1 TB storage included\\n- 100 GB bandwidth per month\\n- Email support with 24-hour response time\\n- 99.95% uptime SLA\\n- Up to 25 team members\\n- Advanced monitoring and alerting\\n- Custom domain support\\n\\nEnterprise Tier (Custom pricing):\\n- Custom API rate limits (100,000+ requests/hour)\\n- Unlimited storage and bandwidth\\n- 24/7 phone and email support with 1-hour response time\\n- 99.99% uptime SLA with service credits\\n- Unlimited team members\\n- Dedicated account manager\\n- Custom integrations and professional services\\n- Private cloud deployment options]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I don't have enough information to answer that question.

    "1. **Diversity is key**: Include 15-30 questions covering different:\n",
    "   - Question types (factual, procedural, comparison)\n",
    "   - Difficulty levels (simple to complex)\n",
    "   - Edge cases (missing info, ambiguous queries)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High-quality ground truth**:\n",
    "   - Write clear, accurate reference answers\n",
    "   - Include specific details (numbers, names, dates)\n",
    "   - Test \"I don't know\" handling with out-of-scope questions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Representative of production**:\n",
    "   - Use real user questions when possible\n",
    "   - Mirror actual query patterns\n",
    "   - Include common pain points\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Choosing Appropriate Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**For accuracy-critical applications** (medical, legal, financial):\n",
    "- Prioritize: Faithfulness, Context Recall\n",
    "- Target: >0.8 on both\n",
    "\n",
    "**For customer support / Q&A**:\n",
    "- Prioritize: Answer Relevancy, Faithfulness\n",
    "- Target: >0.7 on both\n",
    "\n",
    "**For exploratory / research**:\n",
    "- Prioritize: Context Recall, Context Precision\n",
    "- Target: >0.6 on both\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Optimization Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "**If Faithfulness is low (<0.7)**:\n",
    "- Improve prompt to emphasize context adherence\n",
    "- Reduce LLM temperature (make it more deterministic)\n",
    "- Add explicit instruction: \"Only use information from context\"\n",
    "- Use stronger LLM (GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If Answer Relevancy is low (<0.7)**:\n",
    "- Improve prompt focus and clarity\n",
    "- Filter retrieved chunks by relevance score\n",
    "- Add query preprocessing (spell check, expansion)\n",
    "- Tune retrieval parameters (k value)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If Context Precision is low (<0.6)**:\n",
    "- Optimize chunk size (test 512, 1024, 2048)\n",
    "- Adjust k value (test 3, 4, 5, 6)\n",
    "- Improve document metadata for filtering\n",
    "- Consider hybrid search (keyword + semantic)\n",
    "\n",
    "**If Context Recall is low (<0.6)**:\n",
    "- Increase k value (retrieve more chunks)\n",
    "- Improve chunking strategy (reduce overlap)\n",
    "- Enhance document preprocessing\n",
    "- Consider multi-query retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Regular Evaluation Cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial development**: Evaluate after each major change\n",
    "2. **Pre-production**: Full evaluation on comprehensive test set\n",
    "3. **Production**: \n",
    "   - Weekly automated evaluation\n",
    "   - Monthly review of failed queries\n",
    "   - Quarterly full re-evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Experiment Tracking with OPIK\n",
    "\n",
    "**Track evaluations for better insights**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log all evaluation runs**:\n",
    "   - Automatically log metric scores\n",
    "   - Track configuration parameters\n",
    "   - Record timestamps and metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare experiments**:\n",
    "   - Visualize metric trends over time\n",
    "   - Compare different RAG configurations\n",
    "   - Identify best-performing setups\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Team collaboration**:\n",
    "   - Share results with teammates\n",

    "   - Track live RAG performance\n",
    "   - Alert on metric degradation\n",
    "   - Correlate with user feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup**: Install OPIK (`pip install opik`), configure with API key, and the notebook will automatically log all evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Cost Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduce evaluation costs**:\n",
    "- Use smaller test set for rapid iteration (5-10 questions)\n",
    "- Use full test set (15-30 questions) before deployment\n",
    "- Cache evaluation results for unchanged configs\n",
    "- Use non-LLM metrics for quick checks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated costs** (with GPT-4o-mini):\n",
    "- 10 questions, 4 metrics: ~$0.20-0.40\n",
    "- 20 questions, 4 metrics: ~$0.40-0.80\n",
    "- 4 configs × 20 questions: ~$1.60-3.20"
